        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Lasagna <em>(plural “lasagne”)</em> is a flat and expanded pasta sheet,
         traditionally made in Italy with <strong>Parmigiano-Reggiano</strong> (Parmesan cheese),
         Béchamel sauce (white sauce), and ragù (a meat-based sauce).
         Despite the traditional form still being popular, lasagna has taken on
         many different recipes over the years. The dish is made by stacking
         <em>lasagna sheets on top of each other</em> with meats, vegetables, cheeses,
         and tomato sauce between. It is then baked before being served.</p>

         <p>There is also some difference of opinion as to when the recipe for lasagna
         was first published. Many believe it first hit the papers in <b>Naples (Campania)</b> in Italy. 
         Others stick to the idea that it was first published in the oldest-surviving cookbook in Britain 
         called <em>the Forme of Cury</em>. In modern times the dish can be found in most cookbooks.</p>
