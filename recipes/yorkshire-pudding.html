        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>The secret to getting gloriously puffed-up Yorkshire puddings 
           is to have the <strong>fat sizzling hot</strong> and don't open the oven door!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>140g plain flour (this is about 200ml/7fl oz)</li>
            <li>4 eggs (200ml/7fl oz)</li>
            <li>200ml milk</li>
            <li>sunflower oil , for cooking</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Drizzle a little sunflower oil evenly into two <em> 4-hole Yorkshire pudding tins</em>
                or two 12-hole non-stick muffin tins and place in the oven to heat through.</li>

            <li>To make the batter, tip 140g plain flour into a bowl and beat in 4 eggs until smooth.</li>

            <li>Gradually add 200ml milk and carry on beating until the mix is completely <strong>lump-free</strong>.
                 Season with salt and pepper.</li>

            <li>Pour the batter into a jug, then remove the hot tins from the oven. 
                <em>Carefully and evenly pour the batter into the holes</em>.</li>

            <li>Place the tins back in the oven and leave undisturbed for 20-25 mins until the puddings have puffed up and browned.</li>

            <li>Serve immediately. You can now cool them and freeze for up to <b>1 month</b>.</li>
        </ol>
